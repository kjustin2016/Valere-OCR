# Capstone LLM Project

This repository is full of all of the work/different scripts that we used throughout the semester for the Capstone Project

We did not know about version history on GitHub before, so every day that we made changes we uploaded a new file to this repository, which is why there are so many scripts.

the finalcodes folder has the most recent/up to date Python scans the different document types (insurance card, facesheet, etc.) and pulls out the relevant info

the queryCodes folder has the final scripts that use the Query feature on AWS Textract to find specific information from the different document types (Asks things like what is the doctors ID on an insurance card)

the SearchingS3Buckets folder contains scripts that scan the S3 buckets in different ways, since it is very hard to crawl through the S3 bucket manually

The rest of the scripts are scripts that we developed throughout the semester, which would show our progress/different things we tried.
